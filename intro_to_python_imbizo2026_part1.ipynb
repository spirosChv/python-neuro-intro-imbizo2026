        "* **Con:** You need to know the values of physical parameters (conductance, capacitance) which are hard to measure.\n",

        "#### 2. Phenomenological Models (\"Top-Down\")\n",
        "These models try to reproduce the *behavior* (phenomenon) without caring about the underlying physics.\n",
        "* **Goal:** To capture the input-output relationship efficiently.\n",
        "* **Example:** The **Izhikevich model**. It uses simple algebra to draw spike shapes that *look* just like real neurons, but the variables $u$ and $v$ don't strictly represent physical ions.\n",
        "* **Pro:** extremely fast and mathematically simple.\n",
